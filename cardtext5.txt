<p>We don’t go it alone&mdash;</p>
<p>Whenever possible, we frame our work in the context of a Peer Group&mdash;five to eight peers who take a transformational leadership
journey together.  This core architecture can then be supplemented with large group training and/or individual coaching.
Peer Groups</p>
<ul>
<li>afford you the smaller scale group conversations required to go deep, while building transformative listening and coaching capabilities</li>
<li>deepen strengthen the bonds and trust amongst your future leaders</li>
<li>build a common language&mdash;a shared leadership vocabulary&mdash;to support each other’s growth and advancement</li>
<li>make one of the most reliable sources of feedback&mdash;from our peers&mdash;accessible</li>
</ul>
<em>It’s the win-win middle ground between classroom training and individual coaching.</em>
