        Professional Services Firm that caters to the middle-market. Participants were
        immersed in a 16-month collaborative journey stretching their capacity to hold
        the context, perspective and resilience required to think on behalf of the
        enterprise, while reconciling the tensions that emerge from needing to take care
        of business locally at the same time. The Firm’s senior leadership team
        partnered with CCBL as faculty for the program creating an opportunity for next
        generation leaders to engage at an entirely new level with their senior
        leadership team.</p>

        <p>The program has become a key fixture in the firm’s overall leadership curriculum

       <p>Emerging Leader Program&mdash;This program is custom-made for emerging leaders.
        It focuses on managers with 5-8 years of experience. With the current trends
        around “The Great Resignation” developing this group of leaders is especially
        important. If these leaders aren’t fully equipped for their leadership role – they
        become less effective in developing and retaining the seniors and associates who
        work for them. When those team members leave, managers become overwhelmed
        with work – further impacting their leadership effectiveness and stress levels. This
        program runs over a 12-month period and demonstrates a commitment to growing
        leaders at the manager level. It’s geared towards helping participants make positive
        changes, both personally and professionally, with a cascading impact on those who
        work on their engagements. It focuses on knowing your leadership impact,
        fostering trust and community in teams, and delivering results that matter.</p>
