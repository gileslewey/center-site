<p>One of the reasons the Center for Character-based leadership has a history of long-term partnerships with our clients is that
we make our clients lives significantly better&mdash;personally and professionally.  We promise to help lighten the load you carry&mdash;both
the internal load of stress and worry&mdash;and the external load of overwhelm.  And then work with you and your teams to pick up the
core life/leadership practices that provide you optimal lift, renewed energy, and the joy of aligned partnership.</p>

<p>Quite simply&mdash;Our mission is to make your life&mdash;and those around you&mdash;better. </p>
