<h7 class="pt-5">Our leadership Programs</h7>
<p>Creating customized leadership journeys is a cornerstone of what we do and one of our passions.</p>
<h2 class="pt-5">Our leadership programs are designed with key principles in mind</h2>

<p class="pt-3">Our leadership programs are designed with key principles in mind
    <ul><li><i>It&apos;s a journey &mdash; not an event.</i>  Our programs span a minimum of one year &mdash; lasting anywhere from 12-18 months  
    </li>
    <li><i>We focus first and foremost on character</i> &mdash; the changes in you that will make the most difference. It&apos;s not just about adding new knowledge and skills.  It&apos;s not only what you think; it&apos;s how you think.  
    </li>
    <li><i>We leverage the power of your peers </i>&mdash; Our peer group process creates the safe and challenging space required to learn from and be challenged by our peers   
    </li>
    <li><i>We create space for Leaders to develop Leaders </i>&mdash; We involve your organizations leaders in the design, delivery, and support of the curriculum whenever possible   
    </li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2 class="pt-5">Based off these principles we create custom programs &mdash; A typical format…</h2>

    <ul><li>Our programs typically include 4-6 live events (in person or virtual) spread out over 12-18 months.  This allows time to build new leadership practices/habits. We use the Leadership Circle 360 Profile, when possible, to provide participants a map and a location to guide their development journey.  
    </li>
    <li>The work happens in community and support of one&apos;s peers.  We use a combination of large group and small groups in our work.  Large groups strengthen bonds across the full community; and provide the context to introduce key concepts to everyone in the same format.   
    </li>
    <li>Small intact groups of 6 to 8 peers (Peer Groups) offer each participant a dedicated support group and allow us to take the key concepts and apply them to participants&apos; real life work/life challenges. The peer group process sets the tone for true commitment to each others&apos; success.  Each peer group is facilitated by a CCBL Coach.     
    </li>
    <li>Whenever possible, we include and partner with the leaders of the firm(s) we are supporting.   This can include partnering with them on design of the curriculum; engaging them as co-faculty for the program, and/or having them serve as mentors to participants in the program.     
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>We offer our leadership programs both in-house at your organization &mdash; as well as in partnership with associations.</b>  With in-house programs, we link the curriculum to the values/behaviors that your culture celebrates and  your strategy requires.  In partnering with associations, we provide first class leadership development for their members while building bonds/sharing best practices across the various association firms.</p>

<h2 class="pt-5">Our curriculum will challenge and stretch you across a progressive ladder of skillsets and mindsets shifts. </h2>

<p class="pt-3">We help you increase your own capacity and character to:
    <ul><li><i>thrive in complexity and change </i>  
    </li>
    <li><i>extend trust and collaboration across an ever-growing network</i>
    </li>
    <li><i>scale one&apos;s leadership &mdash; becoming “leaders of leaders” </i>
    </li>
    <li><i>shift from a reactive mindset to a creative mindset</i>   
    </li>
    </ul></p>
    
<h2 class="pt-5">A personal focus</h2>
<p>We help you identify the 1 big change in you that will have the biggest ROI both personally and professionally.  For example, transforming impatience with others into capacity to connect and listen &mdash; or &mdash; acquiring the emotional courage required to lean into difficult situations.
