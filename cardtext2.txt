<h3>Character first &mdash; Setting a foundation for lasting change</3>
<p>Without the required character scaffolding, the new skills and know how you want to
build into your individual, team, organizational life have no ground on which to land.
It’s like trying to install an advanced app on an old operating system. We set the
foundation with character first &mdash; fostering character strengths that allow these new
leadership capacities to emerge. For example, we help you learn how to:</p>
<ul><li> develop a much more nuanced relationship to control</li>
<li> drop our guard and share our common vulnerabilities</li>
<li> do some serious “ego” work to reduce self-focus</li>
<li> build the emotional courage required to do what’s uncomfortable</li>
<li> build more curiosity into our conversations</li>
<li> give up the need to be right and embrace multiple perspectives</li></ul>
<p>We replace our action urge with strategic patience &mdash; reactivity with intention &mdash;
distraction with full presence. and much, much more.</p>
